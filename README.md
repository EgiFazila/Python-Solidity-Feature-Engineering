# Python-Solidity-Feature-Engineering
A practical, research-friendly toolkit demonstrating how Python can read, parse, and analyze Solidity smart contracts using feature-engineering techniques. Extracts structural and security-relevant signals from Solidity code, detects risky patterns, builds interpretable features, and forms the basis for heuristic or ML-driven security analysis.
